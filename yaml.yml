  Our peoject lets people play Vietnamese poker. 4 players will be able to play
  Vietnamese poker across multiple computers, letting them keep their own hands 
  hidden. The interface allows players to see only a limited number of cards 
  that were played last at a time. Players will be able to see only their own 
  hand and can sort and play their cards however they want. Discrete turns will 
  be taken with a timer that is determined when the lobby is created. A betting 
  system with fake currency will be implemented with a money pot where winning 
  1st and 2nd place and “countering 2’s” will win money.
